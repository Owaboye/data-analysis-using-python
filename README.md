# PROJECT TITLE: School Fee Collection Analysis & Timeliness Reporting

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Yaba Smart Edutech operates a fee-based educational program across multiple schools and academic terms. Management is seeking to understand the performance of its school fee collections, identify trends in payment behavior, measure timeliness, and detect defaulters.

There is a need for a structured analysis that highlights:
- `Actual vs expected` revenue performance
- Defaulters by school and term
- Timeliness of student payments
- Key performance insights to guide financial and operational decisions
